## **Internship Prioritization Story**

##### **Situation:**  
During my internship, I worked from a Jira board that included tasks ranging from simple bug fixes to complex feature development. While I typically worked on one task at a time, I needed to choose tasks based on their importance to the team and the product.
##### **Task:**  
Part of my responsibilities was to ensure that the tasks I selected aligned with team priorities and delivered the most value, especially during times when larger projects tied up team resources.
##### **Action:**  
I prioritized tasks that had the highest urgency or the greatest impact on the user experience. For example, I focused on fixing recurring 400 errors because they affected core functionality and directly impacted users. To ensure alignment with team goals, I regularly communicated with my team lead to confirm priorities and clarify expectations. This allowed me to stay organized and work efficiently.
##### **Result:**  
By focusing on high-priority bug fixes, I contributed to improving the appâ€™s stability and user experience over time. While many of these fixes were small individually, they added up to create a more reliable and enjoyable product for users.
