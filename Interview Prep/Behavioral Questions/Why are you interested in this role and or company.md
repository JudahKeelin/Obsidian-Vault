I’m excited about this role primarily because of the opportunity for growth. CGI is a large company with a strong reputation, offering plenty of opportunities to learn from experienced senior developers and grow both laterally and vertically. I also know several very smart people who work for CGI, and seeing them thrive and stick with the company reassures me that it’s a great place for a long-term career.

This role also aligns with my goals to take on meaningful challenges and continue developing my skills, which makes CGI an ideal environment for me to contribute and grow.
