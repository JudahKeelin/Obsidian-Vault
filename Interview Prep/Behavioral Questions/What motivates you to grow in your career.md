I’m really motivated by the challenge of solving complex problems and optimizing solutions. I enjoy building things, but I especially love making sure my work is efficient in terms of time and space. For example, one of my favorite tasks was designing a cascading delete feature during my internship. It required a more complex approach than anything I’d done before, and seeing how it improved usability for the team made it really rewarding.

Long-term, I’d like to grow into a senior developer or architect role, focusing on backend development with tools like .NET and C#. I’m passionate about improving my skills, especially in understanding the low-level details of frameworks and tools. I want to avoid relying on "black boxes" in my code, so learning what’s happening behind the scenes is really important to me.

Ultimately, I’m motivated by the chance to work on projects that directly impact users. I’d also like to work in a role that allows for remote flexibility and regular hours, so I can plan and balance my life while continuing to contribute to meaningful projects. Knowing that I’m building toward that goal keeps me motivated to grow every day.
