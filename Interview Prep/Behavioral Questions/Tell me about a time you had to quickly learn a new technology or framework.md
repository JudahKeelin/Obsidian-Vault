## **Internship Story**
##### **Situation:**  
When I started my internship, there wasn’t a formal onboarding process. I had no prior experience with the company’s stack—Angular, TypeScript, .NET, or C#—and no professional work experience. On my first day, I was given a guide to set up my computer and directed to the Jira board to pick a task. I had to figure things out on my own and adapt quickly.
##### **Task:**  
I needed to learn the technologies from scratch, understand the codebase, and contribute to both front-end and back-end development projects.
##### **Action:**  
I began with small tasks like changing icons and labels to familiarize myself with the codebase. Within a few weeks, I moved on to fixing 400 errors and making small UI changes. Over time, I gained the confidence to tackle bigger issues. One significant problem involved dates not displaying correctly for users in different countries. Through testing, I traced the issue to a race condition during app initialization. The Angular date pipe was being initialized before the user’s locale was retrieved from the browser. To resolve it, I adjusted the initialization process to ensure the locale was set first, then verified the solution across multiple scenarios.
##### **Result:**  
By the end of my first year, I was working on larger projects, such as developing a new asset deletion method that allowed deletions to cascade through the asset tree. These experiences taught me how to learn new technologies quickly, identify and resolve complex issues, and make meaningful contributions to a professional team.
