I tend to be very detail-oriented, which has helped me avoid many significant mistakes. However, I recently realized that this careful approach sometimes led me to prioritize tasks that were comfortably within my skill set. While this ensured high-quality results, it also limited my opportunities to challenge myself and grow.

Once I recognized this, I made a conscious effort to take on larger, more complex tasks. For example, I recently worked on changing the groupings of items on manifests for our ship and receive module. This required digging into the existing logic and restructuring it to accommodate new grouping requirements without breaking other functionalities. It was a challenging task that required close collaboration with the SME for that module. By methodically analyzing the codebase and thoroughly testing my changes, I was able to deliver a reliable solution.

This experience reinforced the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone. Now, I actively seek out tasks that challenge me, knowing they help me grow and make a greater impact.
