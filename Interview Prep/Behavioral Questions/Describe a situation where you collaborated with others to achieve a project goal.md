## **Climbing Club Leadership Story**
###### **Situation:**  
When I became president of my university’s climbing club, we had only about 15 active members. While the group was passionate, the club lacked visibility, had limited resources, and struggled with low retention rates.
###### **Task:**  
My goal was to grow the club’s membership, increase engagement, and create a sustainable structure for future leadership.
###### **Action:**  
I began by focusing on recruitment. Working with the other officers, I created a schedule to ensure our club was represented at every student organization event. This level of consistent presence set a precedent for future leadership.

To lower barriers to entry, I partnered with the local climbing gym to organize an event where students could climb for free during our first practice. This addressed one of the main challenges of the sport: the cost of gym access. We heavily advertised this event at recruitment events and highlighted our free university rock wall practices on a separate night.

At the event, I set a rule for all officers and existing members: no climbing unless asked for a demonstration. Instead, we focused on talking to new members, manning ropes, and ensuring everyone felt welcome.
###### **Result:**  
The event was a huge success, with over 80 students attending—a record for the gym that still stands. By the end of my term, we grew to over 50 active members, significantly increasing engagement and creating a foundation for continued growth.
