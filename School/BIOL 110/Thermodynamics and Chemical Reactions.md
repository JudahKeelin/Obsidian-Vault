## **Laws of Thermodynamics**

### **First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation)**

- Energy **cannot be created or destroyed**, only transferred or transformed.
- The total energy of a closed system remains constant.
- Example: Chemical energy in glucose is transformed into ATP during cellular respiration.

### **Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy Increases)**

- Every energy transfer increases the **entropy** (disorder) of the universe.
- Energy conversions are never 100% efficient; some energy is lost as heat.
- Example: When ATP is used in muscle contraction, some energy is lost as heat, increasing entropy.

## **Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) and Reaction Spontaneity**

- **Gibbs free energy (ΔG)** determines whether a reaction is **spontaneous** or requires energy input.
- **Equation:**
    ΔG=ΔH−TΔS
    Where:
    - **ΔG** = Gibbs free energy change
    - **ΔH** = (total energy change)
    - **T** = Temperature (Kelvin)
    - **ΔS** = Entropy change

### **Interpretation of ΔG:**

- **ΔG < 0 (Negative):** Reaction is **spontaneous** (exergonic).
- **ΔG > 0 (Positive):** Reaction is **non-spontaneous** (endergonic), requiring energy input.
- **ΔG = 0:** System is at equilibrium (no net change in energy).

## **Endergonic vs. Exergonic Reactions**

### **Exergonic Reactions (Energy-Releasing)**

- **Definition:** Release free energy (ΔG < 0), occur spontaneously.
- **Energy is released as bonds are broken.**
- Example: **Cellular respiration (C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + ATP)**

### **Endergonic Reactions (Energy-Absorbing)**

- **Definition:** Require an input of energy (ΔG > 0), non-spontaneous.
- **Energy is stored in chemical bonds.**
- Example: **Photosynthesis (CO₂ + H₂O + Sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂)**

## **Catabolic vs. Anabolic Reactions**

### **Catabolic Reactions (Break Down Molecules, Release Energy)**

- **Definition:** Large molecules are broken into smaller ones, releasing energy.
- **Exergonic (ΔG < 0):** Releases energy used for cellular processes.
- **Example:** Cellular respiration (glucose is broken down into ATP, CO₂, and H₂O).

### **Anabolic Reactions (Build Molecules, Require Energy)**

- **Definition:** Small molecules are assembled into larger ones, requiring energy.
- **Endergonic (ΔG > 0):** Requires energy input.
- **Example:** Photosynthesis (CO₂ and H₂O are used to build glucose).

---

## **Coupling of Reactions**

- Cells **couple exergonic and endergonic reactions** to drive necessary processes.
- **Example:** ATP hydrolysis (**exergonic**) is coupled with muscle contraction (**endergonic**) to allow movement.

## **ATP: The Energy Currency of the Cell**

- ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is used to store and transfer energy in cells.
- **ATP Hydrolysis (ATP → ADP + Pi):** Highly **exergonic**, releasing energy.
- **ATP Synthesis (ADP + Pi → ATP):** **Endergonic**, requiring energy input.

---

## **Enzymes and Activation Energy**

- **Enzymes lower activation energy**, making reactions occur faster.
- They **do not change ΔG** of a reaction.
- Example: Catalase speeds up the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
