## Photosynthesis
**Location:** Chloroplast (in **mesophyll cells** of leaves)  
**Purpose:** Converts light energy into chemical energy (glucose).  

### **Plant Cell Structure & Photosynthesis**
- **Mesophyll Cells**: Specialized cells in leaves where photosynthesis occurs. They contain **chloroplasts**, which carry out photosynthesis.
- **Chloroplasts**: Organelles responsible for photosynthesis, consisting of:
  - **Outer Membrane** – Encloses the chloroplast.
  - **Intermembrane Space** – The area between the outer and inner membrane.
  - **Inner Membrane** – Regulates the movement of materials into and out of the chloroplast.
  - **Stroma** – Fluid-filled space where the Calvin Cycle occurs.
  - **Grana** – Stacks of thylakoids.
  - **Thylakoids** – Flattened membrane-bound sacs where the light-dependent reactions take place.
  - **Lumen** – The space inside the thylakoids, essential for the proton gradient during ATP synthesis.
- **Stomata**: Pores that allow gas exchange (CO₂ in, O₂ out).
- **Bundle Sheath Cells (C4 Plants Only)**: Found in plants that use C4 photosynthesis, helping to minimize photorespiration.

### **Correct Order of Organization in a Chloroplast:**
**Structural Perspective (Outer to Inner):**
1. **Outer Membrane** → 2. **Intermembrane Space** → 3. **Inner Membrane** → 4. **Stroma** → 5. **Grana** → 6. **Thylakoids** → 7. **Lumen**

**Functional Perspective (Path of a Molecule in Photosynthesis):**
1. **Thylakoids** → 2. **Grana** → 3. **Stroma** → 4. **Inner Membrane** → 5. **Intermembrane Space** → 6. **Outer Membrane**

### Stages:
1. **Light Reactions (Thylakoid Membrane)**  
   - Converts light energy into ATP & NADPH.
   - Splits water (H₂O) to release O₂.
2. **Calvin Cycle (Stroma)**  
   - Uses ATP, NADPH, and CO₂ to make G3P, a precursor for glucose.
   - **Phases:**
     1. **Carbon Fixation** – RuBisCO fixes CO₂ to RuBP.
     2. **Reduction** – ATP and NADPH reduce 3-PGA to G3P.
     3. **Regeneration** – G3P regenerates RuBP using ATP.

**End Products:** O₂, ATP, NADPH, Glucose (after Calvin Cycle completes twice).

**Mnemonic for Calvin Cycle Steps:** **"Fix, Reduce, Regenerate"**

## Cellular Respiration
**Location:** Cytoplasm & Mitochondria  
**Purpose:** Extracts energy from glucose to produce ATP.

### **Animal Cell Structure & Cellular Respiration**
- **Mitochondria**: The powerhouse of the cell where most ATP is produced.
  - **Outer Membrane** – Regulates transport of molecules.
  - **Intermembrane Space** – Accumulates protons for ATP production.
  - **Inner Membrane** – Houses the Electron Transport Chain (ETC).
  - **Cristae** – Folded structures increasing surface area for ATP synthesis.
  - **Matrix** – Location of the Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle).
- **Muscle Cells**: Contain **many mitochondria** due to high energy demands.
- **Red Blood Cells**: Do **not** have mitochondria, so they rely on **glycolysis** for ATP production.
- **Liver Cells**: Play a key role in gluconeogenesis and energy storage.

### **Correct Order of Organization in a Mitochondrion:**
1. **Outer Membrane** → 2. **Intermembrane Space** → 3. **Inner Membrane** → 4. **Cristae** → 5. **Matrix**

##  Final Thoughts
**Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells, inside the chloroplast.**  
**Mitochondria are abundant in high-energy-demand cells like muscle and liver cells.**  
**Red blood cells rely only on glycolysis due to their lack of mitochondria.**  
**Prokaryotic cells lack mitochondria but still perform respiration.**  
**Other cycles regulate metabolism, fats, and nitrogen waste.**
