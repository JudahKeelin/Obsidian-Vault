## **Overview of Membrane Transport**
**Location:** Plasma Membrane  
**Purpose:** Regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell.  

### **Cell Membrane Structure**
- **Phospholipid Bilayer**: Semi-permeable barrier composed of amphipathic phospholipids.
- **Integral Proteins**: Span the membrane, including transport proteins.
- **Peripheral Proteins**: Attach to the surface of the membrane.
- **Glycoproteins & Glycolipids**: Involved in cell recognition and signaling.
- **Cholesterol**: Maintains membrane fluidity, especially in changing temperatures.

### **Types of Transport**
Membrane transport is classified into **Passive Transport** and **Active Transport**.

## **Passive Transport (No Energy Required)**
**Definition:** Movement of molecules **down** their concentration gradient (**high → low**).  

### **1. Simple Diffusion**
- **Direct movement** of small, nonpolar molecules across the membrane.
- **Examples:** O₂, CO₂, and small lipophilic molecules.

### **2. Facilitated Diffusion**
- **Transport proteins assist** the movement of polar or charged molecules across the membrane.
- **Types of Transport Proteins:**
  - **Channel Proteins**: Provide a passage for molecules (e.g., ion channels, aquaporins).
  - **Carrier Proteins**: Bind to specific molecules and undergo conformational change to transport them (e.g., glucose transporters).
- **Examples:** Glucose, Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻.

### **3. Osmosis (Water Diffusion)**
- Movement of **water** across a selectively permeable membrane.
- **Water moves from hypotonic (low solute) to hypertonic (high solute) solutions.**
- **Tonicity Terms:**
  - **Hypotonic Solution** → Water enters cell → **Cell swells (lysis in animal cells, turgid in plant cells).**
  - **Hypertonic Solution** → Water leaves cell → **Cell shrinks (crenation in animal cells, plasmolysis in plant cells).**
  - **Isotonic Solution** → No net movement of water → **Cell maintains its shape.**

## **Active Transport (Energy Required)**
**Definition:** Movement of molecules **against** their concentration gradient (**low → high**) using ATP.

### **1. Primary Active Transport**
- Uses ATP **directly** to transport molecules.
- Example: **Sodium-Potassium Pump (Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase)**
  - Pumps **3 Na⁺ out** and **2 K⁺ in**, maintaining membrane potential.

### **2. Secondary Active Transport (Cotransport)**
- Uses energy from **an existing ion gradient** to transport molecules.
- **Types:**
  - **Symporters**: Move two substances in the **same direction** (e.g., Na⁺/glucose symporter).
  - **Antiporters**: Move two substances in **opposite directions** (e.g., Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter).

## **Bulk Transport (Vesicular Transport)**
**Definition:** Transport of large molecules via vesicles. Requires ATP.

### **1. Endocytosis (Entering the Cell)**
- **Phagocytosis (“Cell Eating”)**: Engulfing large particles (e.g., immune cells engulfing bacteria).
- **Pinocytosis (“Cell Drinking”)**: Engulfing extracellular fluid.
- **Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis**: Specific molecules bind to receptors before being internalized.

### **2. Exocytosis (Exiting the Cell)**
- Vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release contents.
- **Examples:** Neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion.

## **Correct Order of Membrane Transport Hierarchy**
**Structural Perspective (Outer to Inner)**
1. **Extracellular Space** → 2. **Plasma Membrane (Phospholipid Bilayer, Proteins, Cholesterol)** → 3. **Transport Proteins (Channels, Carriers, Pumps)** → 4. **Intracellular Cytoplasm**

**Functional Perspective (Path of a Transported Molecule)**
1. **Passive Transport (Diffusion, Facilitated Diffusion, Osmosis)**
2. **Active Transport (Primary, Secondary Transport)**
3. **Bulk Transport (Endocytosis, Exocytosis)**
