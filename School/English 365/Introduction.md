Hello everybody,

My name is Judah Keelin.

I am originally from Charleston South Caroline, but me and my family moved her to Lafayette when I was around 10.

What kind of job do I want to get after graduation? I actually already have a job lined up, starting in about a week I will be working as a full stack software developer at CGI.

A fun thing I plan to do this semester? One is to start my new career, and another is get my own apartment.
