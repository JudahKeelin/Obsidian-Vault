**Rifting** is a geological process in which Earth's lithosphere (the rigid outer layer) is pulled apart. This process occurs due to tectonic forces that stretch and thin the crust, eventually leading to the formation of a rift valley. Over time, rifting can cause the lithosphere to fracture, creating distinct tectonic plates that move apart from each other.

#### Key Stages of Rifting

1. **Initial Crustal Stretching:** Tectonic forces pull the crust in opposite directions, causing it to thin and create a series of faults. This stretching lowers the crust’s thickness and begins to form a rift valley.

2. **Faulting and Subsidence:** As rifting progresses, the crust fractures into blocks that move downward, creating a central rift valley with steep walls. This structure often resembles a "grabens" (depressed blocks of land between parallel faults) and “horsts” (uplifted blocks).

3. **Magma Intrusion and Volcanism:** When rifting continues, magma from the mantle can rise through fractures, causing volcanic activity along the rift. This process leads to the formation of new crust as magma cools and solidifies.

4. **Ocean Basin Formation:** If rifting progresses far enough, an ocean basin can form. As the two sides of the rift drift further apart, seawater may eventually flood the rift valley, leading to the creation of a new ocean, like how the Atlantic Ocean formed from the separation of Pangaea.

#### Rifting’s Role in Pangaea’s Breakup

In the Mesozoic era, rifting played a critical role in the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. The process began with the separation of Laurasia (northern landmass) from Gondwana (southern landmass), followed by successive rifting stages that formed new oceans and seas, including the Atlantic Ocean. This breakup not only reshaped continents but also altered ocean circulation, climate, and ecological patterns globally.

#### Examples of Modern Rifting

- **East African Rift Valley:** Currently active, it is a classic example of continental rifting that may eventually form a new ocean if the rifting continues.
- **Red Sea:** Formed through rifting between the African and Arabian plates.

Rifting is essential in shaping Earth’s surface over geological time, driving continental drift, ocean formation, and the redistribution of land and sea.
