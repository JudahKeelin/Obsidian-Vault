# Chapter 22 Study Guide Answers

1. **Periods of the Mesozoic Era (in order):** Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous.

2. **Significant Evolutions in the Mesozoic:**
    - Evolution and diversification of reptiles, dinosaurs, birds, and mammals.
    - Development of flowering plants (angiosperms) in the Cretaceous.

3. **[[Stages of Pangaea Breakup]]:**
    - **Triassic:** Initial rifting of Laurasia and Gondwana.
    - **Jurassic:** Further separation of East Gondwana.
    - **Cretaceous:** Separation of South America and Africa.
    - **Cenozoic:** Final separation, including Greenland's detachment.

4. **[[Rifting]]:** A geological process where tectonic plates move apart, essential in the breakup of Pangaea, leading to new ocean basins.

5. **Water Flow Sources:** During Pangaea’s breakup, Tethys Sea flowed into the Atlantic; Pacific waters flowed into the Gulf of Mexico.

6. **Gulf of Mexico Evaporite Environments:** High temperatures and restricted marine inflows led to salt and gypsum deposits.

7. **Australia and Antarctica Separation:** Occurred during the Cretaceous.

8. **Final Stage of Pangaea’s Breakup:** Completed in the Cenozoic, with Greenland separating from Europe and North America.

9. **Temperature Effects from Continental Drift:** The breakup increased temperature gradients, causing warmer global climates but with a higher contrast between equatorial and polar regions.

10. **True/False - Triassic Sediments from Appalachians:** True.

11. **Newark Group:** A sedimentary formation in Eastern North America filled with non-marine sediments and volcanic activity due to rifting.

12. **Salt Dome Formation in Gulf Coast:** Result from low-density salt rising through denser surrounding rock, forming dome-shaped traps for petroleum.

13. **True/False - Salt Domes as Petroleum Traps:** True.


14. **Major Transgression in Mesozoic:** Occurred during the Cretaceous, creating warm, shallow seas ideal for carbonate reef environments.

15. **Mesozoic Tectonic Events in Western North America:** 
	1. Sonoma
	2. Nevadan
	3. Sevier
	4. Laramide Orogenies
---
16. **Driving Force of Mesozoic Tectonics:** The subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath the North American plate.

17. **Franciscan Complex Rocks:** Includes graywackes, volcanic breccias, pillow basalts, and high-pressure metamorphic blueschists.

18. **Nevadan Orogeny Rocks:** Emplacement of large granite batholiths in the Sierra Nevada due to subduction-related volcanism.

19. **True/False - Volcanic Regions and Subduction Angles:** False.

20. **Cause of Sevier Orogeny:** A decrease in the angle of the subducting plate, moving tectonic activity eastward.

21. **Regions Affected by Cordilleran Orogenies:**
    - **Nevadan:** Sierra Nevada and adjacent areas.
    - **Sevier:** Rocky Mountain region.
    - **Laramide:** New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming.

22. **Chinle Formation and Navajo Sandstone Formation:**
    - **Chinle (Triassic):** Known for petrified wood.
    - **Navajo (Jurassic):** Famous for large sand dunes.

23. **Morrison Formation Development:** Formed from river and floodplain deposits, notable for dinosaur fossils.

24. **True/False - Accretion of Terranes:** True. Over 25% of western North America’s margin is from accreted terranes.

25. **Mesozoic Mineral Resources:** Includes coal, petroleum, uranium, gold, and copper.

26. **World's Largest Copper Deposits:** Located along the western margins of North and South America, formed during Mesozoic and Cenozoic.

27. **Mesozoic Mollusks Classes:** Bivalves, cephalopods, and gastropods.

28. **Guide Fossil for Triassic-Cretaceous:** Ammonoids, particularly belemnites.

29. **Important Reef Builders:** Scleractinian corals and rudists.

30. **Primary Producers and Consumers in Mesozoic Seas:**
    - Producers: Phytoplankton like coccolithophores, diatoms, and dinoflagellates.
    - Consumers: Mollusks, fish, and marine reptiles.

31. **Angiosperms:** Flowering plants that developed in the Cretaceous, enabling more efficient seed dispersal and pollination.

32. **Archosaur Descendants:** Include crocodiles, dinosaurs, birds, and flying reptiles.

33. **Saurischia vs. Ornithischia Pelvic Structures:** Saurischia are lizard-hipped; Ornithischia are bird-hipped.

34. **Theropods vs. Sauropods:**
    - **Theropods:** Bipedal carnivores.
    - **Sauropods:** Large, quadrupedal herbivores.

35. **Familiar Genera of Theropods and Sauropods:** T. rex (Theropod) and Brachiosaurus (Sauropod).

36. **Ornithischian Beak Use:** For cropping vegetation.

37. **Stegosaur Tail Spikes:** Likely used for defense.

38. **Dinosaurs with Horns:** Triceratops and other Ceratopsians.

39. **Evidence for Warm-Blooded Dinosaurs:** Blood vessel openings in bones, high food intake, and possibly 4-chambered hearts.

40. **Pterosaurs are not direct ancestors of birds or bats.** They were a distinct group of flying reptiles that developed unique wing structures, where their wings were supported by an elongated fourth finger. Birds evolved from small theropod dinosaurs, not from pterosaurs.

41. **Plesiosaurs:** Marine reptiles with long necks, likely came ashore to lay eggs.

42. **Probable Bird Ancestors:** Small theropod dinosaurs, with Archaeopteryx as a key transitional fossil.

43. **Mammals Evolved from:** Cynodont therapsids, distinguished by specific jaw and ear bone structures.

44. **Three Middle Ear Bones in Mammals:** Malleus, incus, and stapes.

45. **Marsupials vs. Placentals:** Marsupials carry underdeveloped young in pouches; placentals nourish young internally until birth.

46. **Mammalian Characteristics:** Differentiated teeth, large brains, and secondary palates for breathing while feeding.

47. **Common Mammals Today:** Mostly placentals, representing about 90% of all mammals.

48. **Cretaceous Mass Extinction Cause:** Likely due to meteor impact (Chicxulub Crater) and/or volcanic eruptions (Deccan Traps).

49. **Food Chain Collapse from Meteorite Impact:** Impact blocked sunlight, halting photosynthesis and disrupting ecosystems.
